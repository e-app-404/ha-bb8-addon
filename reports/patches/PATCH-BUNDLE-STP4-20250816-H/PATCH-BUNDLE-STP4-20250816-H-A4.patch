### A4) Helper function for expected LED pattern (let Copilot extract values)

> **Instruction to Copilot:** Read `tests/test_facade.py::test_sleep_mapping` and extract the exact 5 RGB tuples expected. Then implement `_sleep_led_pattern()` in `bb8_core/facade.py` accordingly. **Do not guess.**

+      - Return them as a list of tuples, e.g., [(r1,g1,b1), ... (r5,g5,b5)]
