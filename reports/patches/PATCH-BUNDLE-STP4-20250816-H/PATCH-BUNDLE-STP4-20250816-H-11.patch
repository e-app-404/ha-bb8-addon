*** Patch 11 — Update Failing Test: tests/test_discovery_publisher.py::test_scanner_discovery_uses_hook_when_set ***

Goal: Make this integration-ish test deterministic like Patch 10 by using dual seam injection (module-level hook + patched seam function) and a brief wait for the MQTT on_connect callback thread.

```

Run / Verify

```
python -m compileall -q . && echo READY
pytest -q -rA -k "scanner_discovery_uses_hook_when_set" --maxfail=1
pytest -q -rA -k "scanner_only_discovery or seam_direct or uses_hook_when_set" --maxfail=1
```

Acceptance

- The test_scanner_discovery_uses_hook_when_set flips stub.called == True within the wait window.
- Logs may show scanner_pub_source=hook or be silent when the seam is patched — both acceptable. The assertion is on actual invocation.
