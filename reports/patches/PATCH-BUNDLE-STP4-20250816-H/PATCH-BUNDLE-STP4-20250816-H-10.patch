*** Patch 10 — Deterministic seam usage in integration test ***

Problem: tests/test_scanner_discovery_uses_hook_when_set intermittently fails because the MQTT on_connect callback resolves the module publisher (scanner_pub_source=module) instead of the injected hook. Root causes observed: timing across threads and potential module aliasing.Fix: In the test, set the module-level hook and patch the seam function to belt‑and‑suspenders guarantee the stub is returned, then wait briefly for the callback thread.

```

*** Optional hardening — mqtt_dispatcher seam read consistency ***

When to apply: Only if you still see scanner_pub_source=module while the test sets the hook. This adds a defensive read of the hook from the authoritative module object to survive any import alias

Run block (focused)

```
python -m compileall -q . && echo READY
pytest -q -rA -k "scanner_discovery_seam_direct or scanner_only_discovery" --maxfail=1
pytest -q -rA -k discovery_publisher --maxfail=1
```

Acceptance: The integration test reliably flips the stub (stub.called is True), and logs may show either scanner_pub_source=hook (if _get_scanner_publisher log runs) or no seam log when patched — both are acceptable; the assertion is on actual invocation.
