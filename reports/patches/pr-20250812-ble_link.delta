Scope (must-have):

- Deterministic scan → connect → service probe by MAC using Bleak.
- Reconnect loop with back-off (e.g., 1s → 2s → 5s, capped).
- Capability probe (read a benign char or version/battery) on connect to mark “verified”.
- Emit/maintain:
  - bb8/connected (online|offline) and bb8/rssi (number) topics.
  - Heartbeat (e.g., bb8/telemetry/ping) at interval.
- Gate command handlers: only execute device actions when connected==true (else publish bb8/event/rejected with reason offline).

Evidence (binary acceptance for this PR):

- Connect within ≤10s, reconnect within ≤5s after forced drop.
- On led and drive commands: both a facade echo and at least one device echo (e.g., read-back or success event) recorded; latency_ms ≤ 2000.
- ha_discovery_dump.json → PASS, includes binary_sensor.connected and sensor.rssi.
