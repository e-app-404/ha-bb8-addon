Here is a deep technical audit of `addon_config.py` for your Home Assistant add-on, focusing on config file discovery, error handling, security, reliability, and maintainability:

---

### 1. Config File Search & Loading Logic

**Paths Searched:**

- `"config.yaml"` (relative, likely cwd)
- `"/addons/local/beep_boop_bb8/config.yaml"`
- `"/Volumes/addons/local/beep_boop_bb8/config.yaml"`
- `"/app/config.yaml"`

**Logic:**

- Iterates through the above paths, attempting to open each.
- On success, loads YAML, extracts `options` block if present, and optionally validates against a schema.
- Returns the first successfully loaded config.

**Potential Issues:**

- **Hardcoded paths:** Not dynamic; may not match actual deployment (especially in containers).
- **No environment variable override:** Cannot customize config path via env.
- **No fallback to Home Assistant add-on config API:** Does not use `/data/options.json` for YAML config, only for JSON options.

---

### 2. Path Handling, Environment Detection, Container Compatibility

**Strengths:**

- Multiple paths increase chance of finding config in dev or prod.
- Uses `/data/options.json` for Home Assistant add-on options (good practice).

**Weaknesses:**

- **No use of `os.path.exists` before open:** Relies on exception handling for missing files.
- **No detection of running inside Home Assistant container:** Should prefer `/data/config.yaml` or `/data/options.json` in add-on containers.
- **Relative path `"config.yaml"`** may fail if cwd is not set correctly (e.g., in Docker).
- **No support for environment variable override** (e.g., `CONFIG_PATH`).

---

### 3. Error Handling & Logging

**Strengths:**

- Logs attempts to load each path.
- Logs warnings for missing files and exceptions.
- Logs final config keys and sources.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Error messages may be too verbose for production.**
- **No escalation for critical config missing:** Only logs errors, does not raise or exit.
- **No clear separation between dev and prod logging levels.**
- **Does not log which config file was finally used (only first found).**

---

### 4. Security, Reliability, Maintainability

**Security:**

- **Sensitive values (MQTT_PASSWORD) are masked in logs.**
- **No validation of file permissions or ownership.**
- **No support for secrets management (e.g., Home Assistant secrets.yaml).**

**Reliability:**

- **Config loading may silently fall back to defaults if all files are missing.**
- **No retry or fallback logic if config is partially loaded.**
- **No schema enforcement beyond basic type checks.**

**Maintainability:**

- **Config keys and YAML keys are mapped manually; could be DRYed.**
- **No support for dynamic config reloads.**
- **No clear separation between config loading and validation.**

---

### 5. Code That Could Cause Add-on to Fail to Find Config

- If the config file exists in a path not listed, it will not be found.
- If the working directory is not set to the add-on root, `"config.yaml"` will fail.
- If running in a container, `/app/config.yaml` may not exist.
- No support for `/data/config.yaml` (common in Home Assistant add-ons).
- No environment variable override for config path.

---

### 6. Recommendations & Code-Level Insights

#### **Config Discovery**

- Add support for environment variable override:

  ```python
  config_path = os.environ.get("CONFIG_PATH")
  if config_path and os.path.exists(config_path):
      paths.insert(0, config_path)
  ```

- Prefer `/data/config.yaml` and `/data/options.json` for Home Assistant add-ons.
- Use `os.path.exists` before attempting to open files.

#### **Error Reporting**

- Escalate to error/critical log if no config is found.
- Log which config file was used.
- Consider raising an exception or exiting if critical config is missing.

#### **Integration with Home Assistant Best Practices**

- Use `/data/options.json` as the primary config source for add-ons.
- Support secrets via Home Assistant's secrets.yaml if possible.
- Document config precedence and override logic.

#### **Code Improvements**

- Refactor config key mapping to use a schema-driven approach.
- Separate config loading, validation, and application.
- Add unit tests for config loading in different environments.

### **Summary Table**

| Area                | Current State                                      | Recommendation                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Path Handling       | Hardcoded, no env override, no `/data/config.yaml` | Add env override, prefer `/data/config.yaml`         |
| Error Handling      | Logs, but does not escalate or exit                | Escalate critical errors, log used config file       |
| Security            | Masks password, no secrets.yaml support            | Integrate secrets.yaml, validate file permissions    |
| Reliability         | Silent fallback to defaults                        | Fail fast if critical config missing                 |
| Maintainability     | Manual mapping, no schema enforcement              | Schema-driven, DRY mapping, unit tests               |

### **Actionable Code Example**

Add environment variable and `/data/config.yaml` support:

```python
def _load_yaml_cfg() -> Dict:
    paths = []
    env_path = os.environ.get("CONFIG_PATH")
    if env_path:
        paths.append(env_path)
    paths += [
        "/data/config.yaml",  # Home Assistant add-on standard
        "config.yaml",
        "/addons/local/beep_boop_bb8/config.yaml",
        "/Volumes/addons/local/beep_boop_bb8/config.yaml",
        "/app/config.yaml"
    ]
    for p in paths:
        if os.path.exists(p):
            try:
                with open(p, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                    # ...existing code...
            except Exception as e:
                # ...existing code...
```
