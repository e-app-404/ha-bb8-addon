## PATCH 2025-08-07: Fix BB-8 constructor for spherov2 adapter_cls

- Updated imports in bb8_core/ble_bridge.py and bb8_core/mqtt_dispatcher.py:
  - Now import BleakAdapter from spherov2.adapter.bleak_adapter
  - All BB8() instantiations now pass both address and adapter_cls=BleakAdapter
- Updated bb8_find() to use find_toys(adapter_cls=BleakAdapter) and return BB8(toy.address, adapter_cls=BleakAdapter)
- Updated turn_on_bb8() and turn_off_bb8() to use adapter_cls=BleakAdapter
- All other Pulse Sunrise and power handler code remains unchanged
- Lint errors for unresolved import are expected in static analysis, but correct at runtime if spherov2 is installed in the container
- This resolves the positional argument error and enables actual BLE command transmission
- Version: 0.2.1
