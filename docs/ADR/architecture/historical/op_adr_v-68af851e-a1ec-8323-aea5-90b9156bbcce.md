# ADR-TEST-0001: STP5 Telemetry Attestation (Supervisor-only) — Protocol & Evidence

**Session Evidence Source:** “HA-BB8 Supervisor-only Verification Report” + subsequent attestation runs and MQTT probes shared in-session (multiple code blocks).

## Context
**Problem Statement:** Prove add-on health and telemetry pipeline correctness under Supervisor-only constraints (no `docker exec`), and generate device-originated (BLE) attestation evidence when required.

**Investigation Method:** Live Supervisor logs collection (`ha addons logs …`), MQTT round-trip probes with `mosquitto_pub/sub`, and running `/config/domain/shell_commands/stp5_supervisor_ble_attest.sh` with and without BLE enforcement. Evidence files read from `/config/reports/*`.

**Evidence Gathered:**
- **Log banner pattern (repeated at 15s):**
```

2025-09-03T10:24:36+01:00 \[BB-8] HEALTH\_SUMMARY main\_age=1.4s echo\_age=0.7s interval=15s

```
- **Echo receipt (from add-on logs):**
```

2025-09-03 10:23:35,217 INFO Received message on bb8/echo/cmd: b'{"value":1}'

```
- **End-to-end echo probe (host → add-on → host):**
```

bb8/echo/cmd {"value":1}
bb8/echo/ack {"ts": ..., "value": 1}
bb8/echo/state {"ts": ..., "state": "touched"}

```
- **BLE-enforced attestation sample (failure case):**
```

"window\_duration\_sec": 18,
"echo\_count\_total": 10,
"ble\_true\_count": 0,
"echo\_rtt\_ms\_p95": 0,
"verdict": "FAIL"

```
- **Non-BLE enforcement (pass):**
```

SUMMARY: NO\_BLE verdict=PASS window=10s echoes=8 p95\_ms=0 ARTIFACTS=/config/reports/stp5\_runs/20250903\_124929

````

## Decision
**Technical Choice:** Use a Supervisor-only attestation runner that:
- Publishes echo bursts over MQTT and listens for `ack/state/telemetry` under the configured base.
- Computes window duration, echo count, and p95 RTT.
- Optionally enforces BLE device-originated evidence (`ble_ok==true` in telemetry).

**Command/Configuration (as executed):**
```bash
# Read base & topics then probe echo
BASE=$(jq -r '.mqtt_base // "bb8"' /data/options.json)
E_CMD=$(jq -r '.mqtt_echo_cmd_topic // empty' /data/options.json); [ -z "$E_CMD" ] && E_CMD="$BASE/echo/cmd"

mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.0.129 -p 1883 -u mqtt_bb8 -P mqtt_bb8 \
-t "$BASE/echo/#" -C 3 -W 8 -v & SP=$!; sleep 0.2
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.0.129 -p 1883 -u mqtt_bb8 -P mqtt_bb8 \
-t "$E_CMD" -m '{"value":1}'
wait $SP || true
````

```bash
# BLE-enforced attestation (example profile that ran)
HOST=192.168.0.129 PORT=1883 USER=mqtt_bb8 PASS=mqtt_bb8 BASE=bb8 \
DURATION=30 BURST_COUNT=10 BURST_GAP_MS=2000 REQUIRE_BLE=true \
/config/domain/shell_commands/stp5_supervisor_ble_attest.sh
```

**Validation Results:**

* **Pass (NO\_BLE mode):** `STP5 PASS (binary criteria met)`, artifacts under `/config/reports/stp5_runs/<ts>`.
* **Fail (BLE enforced):** `ble_true_count: 0`, `verdict: FAIL`, confirming correct gating when no device-originated evidence is present.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Attestation works end-to-end under Supervisor-only constraints.
* Echo pipeline verified with explicit `ack/state` publications.
* Criteria gates (window ≥10s, echoes ≥3, RTT p95 ≤250ms, BLE evidence when required) function correctly.

### Negative

* BLE evidence frequently absent (`ble_ok:false`) during tests; requires device wake and/or BLE stack availability.
* Some runs showed window too short when the script exited early.

### Unknown/Untested

* BLE readiness root cause (device sleep vs BlueZ permissions) not fully resolved in-session.
* No measured non-zero RTTs in provided samples.

## Implementation Evidence

### Commands Verified

```bash
ha addons info local_beep_boop_bb8
ha addons logs local_beep_boop_bb8 --follow
mosquitto_sub … ; mosquitto_pub …
/config/domain/shell_commands/stp5_supervisor_ble_attest.sh
```

### Configuration Discovered

```yaml
options:
  mqtt_base: bb8
  mqtt_host: 192.168.0.129
  mqtt_port: 1883
  mqtt_user: mqtt_bb8
  mqtt_password: mqtt_bb8
  enable_echo: true
  enable_health_checks: true
  ble_adapter: hci0
  bb8_mac: ED:ED:87:D7:27:50
  # (later) mqtt_echo_cmd_topic, mqtt_ble_ready_cmd_topic, mqtt_ble_ready_summary_topic (overrides)
```

### Log Patterns Observed

```
[BB-8] HEALTH_SUMMARY main_age=Xs echo_age=Ys interval=15s
Connected to MQTT broker with rc=Success
Subscribed to bb8/echo/cmd
Received message on bb8/echo/cmd: b'{"value":1}'
{"event": "version_probe", "bleak": "0.22.3", "spherov2": "0.12.1"}
```

## Gaps Requiring Further Investigation

* Confirm BLE access via DBus/BlueZ under Supervisor; tools like `btmgmt`/`hcitool` absent in container.
* Determine reliable wake sequence for BB-8 to achieve `ble_ok:true` telemetry during the attestation window.

## References

* **Source Files Examined:** `/data/options.json` (materialized options), add-on logs.
* **Commands Executed:** As listed above (all provided in-session).
* **Tests Performed:** Multiple `stp5_supervisor_ble_attest.sh` runs with/without `REQUIRE_BLE=true`; live MQTT probes.
* **Session Sections:** “Supervisor-only Verification Report”, “End-to-end echo probe”, attestation outputs with metrics JSON.

# ADR-OPS-0002: Supervisor-only Deployment & Operations for HA-BB8 Add-on

**Session Evidence Source:** Add-on info dump, live logs, and SSH/HA CLI execution transcripts.

## Context
**Problem Statement:** Operate and validate the add-on without container shell access; all diagnostics via Supervisor and MQTT.

**Investigation Method:** `ha addons info/logs`, observed add-on metadata and options, MQTT probes, and attestation scripts executed on the HA host.

**Evidence Gathered:**
- Add-on state shows **`startup: services`**, **`host_dbus: true`**, device **`/dev/hci0`**, **`apparmor: disable`**, **`ip_address: 172.30.33.7`**.
- Options include MQTT connectivity & topics; logs accessible via Supervisor.
- A failed remote run showed broker ACL error:
````

Connection Refused: not authorised.

````

## Decision
**Technical Choice:** Adopt a **Supervisor-only** operational model:
- All checks through `ha addons info|logs`.
- MQTT validation via `mosquitto_pub/sub` from the HA host.
- Attestation scripts live under `/config/domain/shell_commands/…` and are invoked locally.

**Validation Results:**
- Supervisor logs show continuous `HEALTH_SUMMARY` lines at 15s cadence.
- MQTT SUBACK `Subscribed (mid: 1): 0` confirmed subscription authorisation during one probe.
- A separate SSH-initiated run hit `not authorised`, indicating environment-specific broker ACL behavior; resolved by running locally on HA host with correct credentials.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Minimal operational surface; no reliance on container exec.
- Deterministic locations for artifacts under `/config/reports/*`.

### Negative
- Debug depth limited to what is emitted to stdout/log file.
- Broker ACL differences between hosts can surprise remote invocations.

### Unknown/Untested
- Automated rollback via Supervisor was not exercised; manual redeploy path not demonstrated in-session.

## Implementation Evidence

### Commands Verified
```bash
ha addons info local_beep_boop_bb8
ha addons logs local_beep_boop_bb8 --follow
ssh home-assistant 'bash /config/domain/shell_commands/stp5_supervisor_ble_attest.sh'  # produced "not authorised" in one run
/config/domain/shell_commands/stp5_supervisor_ble_attest.sh                            # ran locally with PASS/FAIL as expected
````

### Configuration Discovered

```yaml
devices:
  - /dev/hci0
host_dbus: true
startup: services
apparmor: disable
options:
  mqtt_host: 192.168.0.129
  mqtt_port: 1883
  mqtt_user: mqtt_bb8
  mqtt_password: mqtt_bb8
  mqtt_base: bb8
```

### Log Patterns Observed

```
[BB-8] HEALTH_SUMMARY main_age=… echo_age=… interval=15s
```

## Gaps Requiring Further Investigation

* Document broker ACLs for remote vs local runs; provide a sanctioned method for remote attestation if needed.
* Formal rollback procedure (snapshot/restore) not executed in-session.

## References

* **Source Files Examined:** Supervisor info/options; report artifacts under `/config/reports/`.
* **Commands Executed:** As above.
* **Session Sections:** Add-on info dump; SSH attempt with “not authorised”; local attestation runs.

# ADR-SUP-0003: Single Control-Plane Supervision & Health Signaling

**Session Evidence Source:** Runloop and child start logs, periodic health summaries observed in Supervisor logs.

## Context
**Problem Statement:** Ensure a single control-plane (`run.sh`) supervises Python children with visible liveness, avoiding multiple s6 longruns.

**Investigation Method:** Log inspection of startup and heartbeat messages; review of service wiring statements reported in-session.

**Evidence Gathered:**
- Startup emits:
````

Started bb8\_core.main PID=121
Started bb8\_core.echo\_responder PID=126

```
- Logging setup confirmation:
```

\[LOGGING DEBUG] Resolved LOG\_PATH candidate: /data/reports/ha\_bb8\_addon.log
\[LOGGING DEBUG] Writable: True

```
- Health enablement:
```

main.py health check enabled: /tmp/bb8\_heartbeat\_main interval=5s

```
- Periodic health:
```

\[BB-8] HEALTH\_SUMMARY main\_age=Xs echo\_age=Ys interval=15s

```
- s6 echo longrun intentionally down (by design) — stated in session recap.

## Decision
**Technical Choice:** Maintain a **single control-plane** (`run.sh`) that launches:
- `bb8_core.main` (bridge controller)
- `bb8_core.echo_responder` (MQTT echo loop)
…and emits liveness via:
- heartbeat files (`/tmp/bb8_heartbeat_main`, `/tmp/bb8_heartbeat_echo`)
- periodic `HEALTH_SUMMARY` logs at 15s.

**Validation Results:** Supervisor logs show both child starts and continuous health summaries. Logging path writable.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear, low-noise supervision surface.
- Health/liveness observable without container shell.

### Negative
- If heartbeats stall, only recovery path is via Supervisor (restart or redeploy).

### Unknown/Untested
- Child crash/respawn behavior wasn’t captured with explicit exit codes in provided logs.

## Implementation Evidence

### Log Patterns Observed
```

Started bb8\_core.main PID=121
Started bb8\_core.echo\_responder PID=126
\[BB-8] HEALTH\_SUMMARY main\_age=… echo\_age=… interval=15s

```

### Configuration/Paths Discovered
```

/data/reports/ha\_bb8\_addon.log
/tmp/bb8\_heartbeat\_main
/tmp/bb8\_heartbeat\_echo

```

## Gaps Requiring Further Investigation
- Capture and document `dead=<proc> exit_code=<n>` lines on intentional crash tests.
- Confirm `services.d/echo_responder/down` is present in final image for s6 isolation (stated; not shown as file listing).

## References
- **Source Files Examined:** (by behavior) `run.sh` supervision outputs, logging path usage.
- **Commands Executed:** `ha addons logs … --follow` to observe startup/heartbeat messages.
- **Session Sections:** Startup and health summary excerpts.

# ADR-INTEG-0004: MQTT/BLE Integration — Topics, Auth, Evidence Fields

**Session Evidence Source:** Options dump, MQTT probe transcripts, log messages, telemetry records.

## Context
**Problem Statement:** Validate the integration surfaces: MQTT topics and BLE readiness endpoints, including configurability and observed message shapes.

**Investigation Method:** Live `mosquitto_pub/sub` probes; inspection of `/data/options.json` (via Supervisor report); observation of add-on logs.

**Evidence Gathered:**
- MQTT connectivity (log):
```

Starting MQTT loop on 192.168.0.129:1883
Connected to MQTT broker with rc=Success
Subscribed to bb8/echo/cmd

```
- Topic activity:
```

bb8/echo/cmd {"value":1}
bb8/echo/ack {"ts": ..., "value": 1}
bb8/echo/state {"ts": ..., "state": "touched"}
bb8/telemetry/echo\_roundtrip {"ts": ..., "rtt\_ms": 0, "ble\_ok": false, "ble\_latency\_ms": null}  # observed earlier

```
- BLE readiness topics (configurable; confirmed messages):
```

bb8/ble\_ready/summary {"ts": ..., "detected": false, "attempts": 0, "source": "echo\_responder"}

```
- Credentials & host (from options):
```

mqtt\_host: 192.168.0.129
mqtt\_port: 1883
mqtt\_user: mqtt\_bb8
mqtt\_password: mqtt\_bb8
mqtt\_base: bb8

```
- BLE hardware requirement: `/dev/hci0`, adapter `hci0`; MAC `ED:ED:87:D7:27:50`.
- Version probe banner:
```

{"event": "version\_probe", "bleak": "0.22.3", "spherov2": "0.12.1"}

````

## Decision
**Technical Choice:** Use base-prefixed MQTT topics with optional overrides via options:
- Echo:
- CMD: `<base>/echo/cmd`
- ACK: `<base>/echo/ack`
- STATE: `<base>/echo/state`
- TELEMETRY RTT: `<base>/telemetry/echo_roundtrip` (fields: `ts`, `rtt_ms`, `ble_ok`, `ble_latency_ms`)
- BLE readiness:
- CMD: `<base>/ble_ready/cmd`
- SUMMARY: `<base>/ble_ready/summary`
- Options support overriding topic names (e.g., `mqtt_echo_cmd_topic`, `mqtt_ble_ready_cmd_topic`, `mqtt_ble_ready_summary_topic`) — confirmed operational via probe with overrides.

**Validation Results:**
- Echo responder subscribed and published on expected topics (confirmed by `mosquitto_sub` capture).
- BLE summary published on configured topic; `detected:false` in samples.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Topic overrides verified to work; supports multi-instance/naming conventions.
- Echo telemetry includes BLE evidence fields for attestation gating.

### Negative
- BLE readiness frequently false in-session; device state or BlueZ access likely factors.

### Unknown/Untested
- Non-default QoS/retain behaviors beyond shown `qos:1` publish paths not varied in-session.

## Implementation Evidence

### Commands Verified
```bash
# Echo probe with topic overrides sourced from options.json

# ADR-OPS-0005: VCS Guardrails — Prevent Mass Deletions & Large Files (Operational)

**Session Evidence Source:** Git push outputs, ADR guard messages, hook installation transcript.

## Context
**Problem Statement:** Repeated accidental mass deletions/large artifacts entering the repo; pushes blocked by existing ADR guard; need automated prevention.

**Investigation Method:** Observed push failures and warnings; installed `.githooks` (pre-commit/pre-push) and hardened `.gitignore`.

**Evidence Gathered:**
- Push guard messages:
````

Push blocked by ADR-0001 guard.
ERROR: workspace must NOT contain: tools
ERROR: addon must NOT contain: addon/.ruff\_cache

```
- Large file warnings on push:
```

GH001: Large files detected … *backups/wtree*\*.tgz …

````
- Hook installation (reported done) and `.gitignore` hardening (added ignores for `_backups/`, `reports/`, caches, etc.).

## Decision
**Technical Choice:** Enforce local VCS guardrails:
- **.gitignore** includes caches/reports/backups/tarballs to avoid accidental staging.
- **pre-commit**: block >N deletions (default 10) and large files (>10MB) unless override env set.
- **pre-push**: enforce ADR workspace rules (e.g., `addon/app` present; `tools/` absent).

**Validation Results:** Hooks installed and made executable; local commits subject to guard; prior ADR-0001 remote guard also observed blocking pushes.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Prevents repeat of mass-delete incidents and accidental large artifacts.
- Aligns local dev with repo ADR governance.

### Negative
- Requires explicit, documented overrides (`ALLOW_MASS_DELETE=1`, `ALLOW_LARGE_FILES=1`) for exceptional commits.

### Unknown/Untested
- Not all edge cases of generated artifacts exercised; CI policy interaction not tested in-session.

## Implementation Evidence

### Commands Verified
```bash
# (Excerpts from session)
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit .githooks/pre-push
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore(git): harden .gitignore …"
````

### Log Patterns Observed

```
ERROR: pre-push: addon/app missing
ERROR: pre-push: tools directory must not exist
Push blocked by ADR-0001 guard.
```

## Gaps Requiring Further Investigation

* Document override environment variables for one-off exceptions in CONTRIBUTING.
* Validate hooks on all developer platforms (macOS/Linux).

## References

* **Source Files Examined:** `.gitignore` (hardened), `.githooks/` scripts (as described).
* **Commands Executed:** Hook install/config; commits/push attempts with guard messages.
* **Session Sections:** Push failures, hook installation summary.
