🛠️ **DEEP-DIVE STARTUP AUDIT REQUEST — BB-8 HA ADDON**

Please analyze the following Home Assistant add-on startup logs for the `beep_boop_bb8` integration, with emphasis on:

1. **S6 service lifecycle** — initialization, legacy service stop, and overlay compliance
2. **Circular references and import validity** - failing imports, initialization of modules and firing order
2. **BLE runtime execution** — identify cause and impact of the `RuntimeError: no running event loop`
3. **MQTT connectivity** — validation of broker resolution, topics, and client authentication
4. **Task lifecycle issues** — interpretation of `Task was destroyed but it is pending!` error
5. **Config fidelity** — alignment between loaded config and MQTT/adapter behavior
6. **Telemetry and controller lifecycle** — bridge startup, link init/stopped events, controller dispatch, telemetry suppression logic
