SCOPE

CHANGES
- Construct client with v2 callbacks:
    import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
    c = mqtt.Client(callback_api_version=mqtt.CallbackAPIVersion.V5)
- Update on_connect signature to v2: on_connect(client, userdata, flags, reason_code, properties)
- Where on_message used, ensure signature v2: on_message(client, userdata, message)
- Keep username_pw_set and connect logic the same.
- Test: run each tool once to ensure no exceptions.

RECEIPTS
- Commit diff summary (files touched)
- One run output per tool (single line confirming execution)
