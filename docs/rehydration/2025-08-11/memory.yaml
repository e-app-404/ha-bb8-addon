  semantic_summary: >
    The add-on boots deterministically, publishes extended HA discovery via the fa√ßade,
    connects to MQTT cleanly, and avoids secret leakage. BLE actions are scaffolded as
    safe no-ops; telemetry loop and real spherov2 actions remain to be implemented to
    attain full roundtrip evidence.
