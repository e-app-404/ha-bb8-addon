### **Tactical Instructions for the Human Operator**

- Do NOT assume Copilot/GPT has committed any changes until:
  - The patch appears in a tracked file in your repo, AND
  - The Home Assistant add-on container is rebuilt and verified with logs.
- Immediately store this output as a session record (or commit as e.g. `SR-ARTIFACT-BB8_20250806.md`).
- Manually apply all code blocks or diffs included here before proceeding to runtime/build/test steps.

---

**This artifact preserves all session logic, patch instructions, and audit trail.
Manual intervention is required to move from logic to codebase mutation and runtime validation.**---
