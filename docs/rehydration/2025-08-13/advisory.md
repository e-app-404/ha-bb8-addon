6) üìÑ Final Advisory (+ Patch Etiquette doc)
6.1 Token & startup guidance

# Rehydration Advisory [STRATEGOS]

## Token & startup advisory

- Token usage: moderate, safe margin; avoid pasting long full files.
- ‚Äúultra-lean mode‚Äù: unified diffs only, rationale ‚â§ 5 bullets
- Prefer head/tail logs (‚â§150 lines)
- Keep replies surgical: diffs, stubs, and minified JSON.
- Avoid full-file pastes and long logs; show ‚â§150 lines focused excerpts.
- Start next session with Strategos persona, oversight mode, intervention=on.

## Assumptions/risks on resume

- BLE loop thread applied everywhere
- Discovery only from scanner (no dispatcher duplicates)

## Guardrails

- One consolidated delta per cycle
- Evidence-first: run STP4 after each merge
- Never create new topic hierarchies; stick to bb8/...
- Enforce no secrets in logs (booleans for credential presence only).
- One discovery publisher (facade) only; dispatcher stays neutral.
- Keep dispatcher signature stable; deprecate but accept legacy params with warnings.
